## 📈 Data Sources

The application uses a combination of:

1. **Mock Data**: For development and testing
2. **NBA Stats API**: For real-time and historical player statistics
3. **Custom Pre-processed Data**: For efficient loading of large statistical datasets

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dxaginfo/matchup-analyzer-nba-comparison.git
cd matchup-analyzer-nba-comparison
